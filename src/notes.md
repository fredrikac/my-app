## Benefits of typescript
Strongly typed, in contrast to the loosely typed javascript. 
1. Less runtime errors.
2. Better auto-completion while writing code, and better feedback when something does not work. 
3. Custom types
interface - only objects
type - all kinds of types

4. self-documenting - check definitions by hover on the function, click it and f12, which takes me to the function declaration.
